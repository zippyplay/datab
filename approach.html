<h1>Approach</h1>
<p class="tagline">
  Practical, reproducible work — focused on reliable answers and decisions.
</p>

<div class="card">
  <p>
    The goal is not a “fancy model”. The goal is a result you can trust —
    with assumptions made explicit, performance validated, and conclusions explained
    in plain language.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>1) Define the decision</h2>
  <p>
    We start by clarifying the business question, success criteria, constraints,
    timelines, and what a useful output looks like (report, model, or code).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What decision needs to be made?</li>
    <li>What does success look like?</li>
    <li>What are the constraints (time, data, cost, risk)?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>2) Audit the data</h2>
  <p>
    Before analysis, we assess completeness, consistency, definitions, and edge cases.
    This reduces surprises and avoids building on unreliable foundations.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completeness, duplicates, missing values</li>
    <li>Outliers and suspicious patterns</li>
    <li>Metric definitions and data lineage</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>3) Clean and validate</h2>
  <p>
    Cleaning is done with agreed rules and documented checks. The aim is transparency:
    stakeholders should understand what changed and why.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reproducible cleaning steps</li>
    <li>Validation logic and sanity checks</li>
    <li>Data quality summary and known limitations</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>4) Analyse and model</h2>
  <p>
    Methods are chosen to fit the data and the decision. We prioritise robustness,
    interpretability, and realistic performance, rather than black-box complexity.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Exploratory analysis to understand drivers</li>
    <li>Statistical modelling / forecasting where appropriate</li>
    <li>Cross-checks, validation, and error analysis</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>5) Communicate and deliver</h2>
  <p>
    Deliverables are structured so your team can use them immediately and confidently —
    with clear findings, recommendations, assumptions, and next steps.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Concise reporting for non-technical stakeholders</li>
    <li>Reproducible analysis for technical teams</li>
    <li>Documentation and optional walkthrough</li>
  </ul>
</div>
