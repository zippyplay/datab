<h1>Approach</h1>

<p>
I focus on results that are reliable, explainable, and useful. The goal is not a “fancy model” —
it’s a correct answer that supports real decisions.
</p>

<h2>1) Define the problem</h2>
<p>
Clarify the decision, success criteria, constraints, and what “good” looks like before analysis begins.
</p>

<h2>2) Audit the data</h2>
<p>
Assess completeness, consistency, definitions, and known edge cases. Identify data limitations early.
</p>

<h2>3) Clean and validate</h2>
<p>
Apply agreed cleaning rules and validation checks. Produce a clear quality summary so stakeholders
can trust the results.
</p>

<h2>4) Analyse and model</h2>
<p>
Use appropriate statistical and analytical methods, prioritising robustness, interpretability,
and validated performance.
</p>

<h2>5) Communicate and deliver</h2>
<p>
Deliver outputs that are clear and reproducible: findings, recommendations, assumptions, and
limitations — with documentation suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
