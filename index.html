<h2>How we work</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p>
    The work starts with the decision, not the tools.
    Data quality and assumptions are made explicit before
    analysis and modelling begin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Results are delivered with clear explanations,
    documented limitations, and reproducible logic.
  </p>
