<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I provide analytics and modelling services for organisations that need clear answers from complex data.
My focus is practical: define the problem, ensure data quality, apply appropriate methods, and deliver
results that stakeholders can trust.

<p>
Work can be delivered as concise reports, reproducible analysis, or production-ready code, depending
on your needs.
